# echo-registry

This is the official Echo Agent Registry for the Echos ecosystem.

## Register an Echo Agent

To register an Echo Agent, you need to create a new unique directory under `src` and add a new `echo.json` file. Feel free to use any of the existing `echo.json` files as a template.

When you're done, submit a PR to add your Echo Agent to the registry. When your PR is merged, your Echo Agent will be published in a few minutes after the background job completes.
